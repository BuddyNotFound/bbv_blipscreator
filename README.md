Simple Blip Creator script that works with all frameworks and requires only **ox_lib**. This script makes it easy to create new blips and remove ones you no longer need. You can configure permissions so only authorized users can access the commands. It also includes an RGB color selector, letting you choose custom blip colors that arenâ€™t usually available.
